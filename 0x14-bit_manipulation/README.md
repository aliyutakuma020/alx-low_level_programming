Bit Manipulation in C
This C project offers functions for bit manipulation. It includes functions to convert binary to unsigned int, print binary representation, get, set, and clear specific bits, and calculate bit flips between two numbers. Use "main.h" to include the functions in your code. See the example in the main.c file to understand usage. This project is part of ALX School's low-level programming curriculum.
