Singly Linked Lists in C
A singly linked list in C is a data structure with nodes containing data and references to the next nodes. It's ideal for dynamic data storage, insertions, and deletions. While it's not suitable for random access, it's efficient for various applications like stacks and queues. Proper memory management is essential to avoid memory leaks.
